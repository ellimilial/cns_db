# Dependencies of reference datasets

This module contains manually curated interdependencies between constituting reference publications.

These create a graph where a datasource is the node, with multiple edges ending at datasets that were used in its construction.
Initial set consisted of 50 references included in B3DB dataset, and was extended to their constituents, intermediate and inferred datasets.  
The edges were manually extracted from the text of published articles and, where data was available, verified in the dataset.
